# Postmark PHP Library

These are a set of PHP Classes that make it easy to work with [Postmark's](http://postmarkapp.com/) Send Email and Bounce
Retrieval API's. Both classes extend a common parent class which holds the authentication information for Postmark. You
need to register an account with Postmark before you can use this library!

### Support

This project is a work in progress. I've written variations of these libraries in the passed just haven't put them together. 
It should not be used in a production environment unless you are feeling very brave.

Any issues should be posted on the [Github](https://github.com/jesscarlos/Postmark-PHP-Library/issues) page. I will update
the [wiki](https://github.com/jesscarlos/Postmark-PHP-Library/wiki) with documentation accordingly.

#### Requirements
* PHP 5.2+
* cURL Library
* JSON Support

### Licenses

* Postmark (c) 2012 Wildbit, LLC.
